# Text Analysis and Topic Modeling Project
Project in Jupyter nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/julialysova/NLP-Projects/blob/main/quora_clustering/topic_modeling.ipynb

## Data Description

For this project we used a dataset of 400,000 questions from Quora with no labels of their category.

## Aim

To conduct text analysis by means of Spacy library, to prepare our data for further training and to build a model for unsupervised topic modeling of the questions available. 

## Result

Using text embeddings, which is a mean vector of the token' vectors from each question, and KMeans model we successfully defined 30 clusters representing our data.

## Libraries Used

*pandas*, *numpy*, *re*, *collections*, *random*, *spacy*, *sklearn*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *wordcloud*
